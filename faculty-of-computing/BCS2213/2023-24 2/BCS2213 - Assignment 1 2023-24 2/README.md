## Questions
Each  student  of  the  Computer  Faculty  has  a  curriculum  structure  according  to  their respective  departments.  In  general,  the  purpose  of  the  curriculum  structure  is  to  visualize  the registration  of  subjects  in  each  semester.  Based  on  the  visualization,  students  need  to  register their respective subjects using the Open registration system.

In the curriculum structure, several subject groups such as faculty core subjects, departmental  required  subjects,  university  required  subjects  and  elective  subjects  have  been specified  based  on  their  respective  codes.  However,  students  have  the  right  to  determine  the number of credits and what subjects are required during registration for each semester

Based on the curriculum structure and open registration system, you are required to develop a Z specification model using the Z notation tool. The specification should support these requirements:

1.  The system able to login and logout by the student and academic advisor.
2.  The system allows student to register (insert) and withdraw or drop (delete) the subject.
3.  The system allows student to update their registration such as change the section or etc.
4.  The system should provide and alert notification to the academic advisor for approve/disapprove
5.  This system does not allow students to register for subjects exceeding 20 credits per semester.
6.  This system allows academic advising to approve or disapprove subjects registered/withdrawn by students.
7.  The system able to display/print all information of registered subject by student and academic advisor.

Good Luck and Have a Nice Day.
